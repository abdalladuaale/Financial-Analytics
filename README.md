Text Analytics for Financial Decision Support In the world of finance, investors need to stay updated with the latest economic news and events to make informed decisions about their investments However, with the vast amount of economic data available, it can be challenging to extract meaningful insights The purpose of this project is to develop a text analytics decision support system for financial decision-making.

The system will preprocess and analyse the data to identify relevant financial indicators and assess their impact on different sectors. This will provide investors with actionable insights into market trends and changes, enabling them to make informed decisions about their investments.
